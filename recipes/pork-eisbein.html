  <h2>A PORKY DELIGHT</h2>
  <p>We have had quite a few requests for this recipe. To unleash the great flavour and tender, succulent texture of brined and smoked ham hocks, they must first be simmered slowly or slow cooked in the oven to tenderise them. Then baste and brown them in the oven or on the braai. Fresh un-brined or smoked hocks are equally delicious prepared in this way.</p>

  <h2>YOU WILL NEED</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cured and smoked eisbeins</li>
    <li>1 onion quartered</li>
    <li>1 carrot roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 bay leaf</li>
    <li>Water</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>You need to place the pork hocks into a large pot, add all the ingredients, and put in enough water to cover the hocks. Bring it to a boil and then reduce heat, allowing it to simmer for about one and a half hours (90 minutes).</li>
    <li>The meat should be tender and the skins soft. Remove them from the pot and pat dry with a cloth, score the skin diagonally with a sharp knife and salt the skin generously.</li>
    <li>Place the hocks in an oven allowing the skin to crisp up. Keep an eye on them and turn to crisp the entire outside.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Serving suggestion</h4>
  <p>Crispy eisbein is best served with boiled potatoes tossed in butter and parsley with sauerkraut and strong mustard. If you wish, you can also put some apple puree on the table and pour over the meat. Enjoy!</p>
