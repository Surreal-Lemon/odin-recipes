  <h2>AN ALL-AMERICAN CLASSIC</h2>
  <p>This all-American classic cobb salad recipe lines up crispy bacon, succulent chicken and golden boiled eggs with plenty of colourful veg and a drizzle of creamy blue cheese dressing, for an indulgent salad more than worthy of main course status</p>

  <h2>YOU WILL NEED</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>580g pack chicken breasts</li>
    <li>300g unsmoked back bacon</li>
    <li>1 romaine lettuce, trimmed, washed and roughly chopped</li>
    <li>120g radishes, trimmed and finely sliced</li>
    <li>2 avocados, chopped </li>
    <li>80g Stilton, crumbled</li>
    <li>4 hard-boiled eggs, quartered</li>
    <li>85g pack watercress</li>
    <li>250g cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>For the dressing...</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil </li>
    <li>1 tbsp white wine vinegar </li>
    <li>75ml soured cream</li>
    <li>30g Stilton, crumbled</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To make the dressing, whisk all the ingredients together until smooth.</li>
    <li>Heat a griddle pan. Put the chicken between 2 sheets of clingfilm and bash with a rolling pin to an even thickness of about 1cm, then season and rub with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Put the chicken breasts on the hot griddle pan (you may need to cook in batches) and cook for 5 mins. Turn and continue cooking for 5-8 mins or until the chicken is cooked through. Remove and leave to rest for 5 mins, then thickly slice and set aside.</li>
    <li>While the chicken is cooking, put the bacon in a nonstick frying pan and fry until crisp. Set aside to cool, then chop into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>To assemble the salad, arrange all the ingredients in rows on a large plate or platter. Drizzle with the dressing to serve.</li>
  </ol>
