  <h2>SPICE UP YOUR WINTER</h2>
  <p>This Hungarian goulash recipe is a spicy way to dress up stew beef. My mom made this when we were kids, and we loved it. It is spicy but not mouth-burning! It can be made with cheaper cuts of beef and will still turn out very tender. If the stew gets too thick, add a little water while cooking. Garnish with sour cream.</p>

  <h2>YOU WILL NEED</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1/3 cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>3 onions, sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons Hungarian sweet paprika</li>
    <li>3 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>3 pounds beef stew meat, cut into 1 1/2 inch cubes</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>1 can tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Cook and stir onions in oil until soft, 2 to 4 minutes. Remove onions and set them aside.</li>
    <li>Combine paprika, 2 teaspoons salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Coat beef cubes in spice mixture, and cook in the onion pot until brown on all sides.</li>
    <li>Return onions to the pot with beef; pour in water, tomato paste, garlic, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.</li>
  </ol>
