  <h2>EASY LEMON CHICKEN THIGHS WITH HERBS</h2>
  <p>
    These lemon chicken thighs are juicy, flavorful and easy to make. The chicken bursts with flavor thanks to fresh lemon, oregano, thyme, garlic and mustard. We love to use bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs. With that being said, you can also use chicken breasts or chicken drumstics
  </p>

  <h2>YOU WILL NEED</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 bag of chicken thighs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon whole grain mustard</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon zest (1 teaspoon for rub and 2 teaspoons for sauce</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil (1 tablespoon for rub, 1 tablespoon for cooking</li>
    <li>1/4 cup (60ml) lemon juice (about 1 lemon)</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cups (300ml) low-sodium chicken stock</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>

  <h4>PREPARE THE CHICKEN</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oven to 205 degrees C</li>
    <li>Make the rub for chicken. Combine mustard, one teaspoon of the lemon zest, oregano, thyme, salt and one tablespoon of the olive oil in a small bowl. Use fingers or a brush to coat chicken on both sides with the mustard rub.</li>
    <li>In another bowl or measuring jug, combine remaining lemon zest (2 teaspoons), lemon juice and the chicken stock. Set aside.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>COOK THE CHICKEN</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat remaining tablespoon of oil in a large oven-safe skillet or frying pan over medium heat. Add the smashed garlic then cook about 1 minute or until you can smell toasted garlic and the garlic has browned around the edges. Remove and discard the garlic, but leave the oil.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken, skin-side down, into the hot garlic-infused oil and cook 2 to 3 minutes or until the skin has turned golden brown.</li>
    <li>Flip the chicken then add the lemon juice mixture from before. Stir then slide the pan into the oven and bake 25 to 35 minutes or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken reads 80 degrees C.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>TO FINISH</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove pan from oven then transfer the chicken to a plate and cover with aluminum foil. There should still be liquid in the pan. Place the pan over medium heat and bring the liquid to a gentle simmer.</li>
    <li>In a small bowl, use your fingers to mix butter and flour, making a dry, crumbly paste. Whisk the flour and butter into the sauce. The sauce will thicken slightly and look glossy. Nestle the chicken back into the pan then serve.</li>
  </ol>
